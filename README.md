a good web framework

[docs](https://raftar.io/chene/)

## what to expect

this is something i made for myself and my friends because i am unsatisfied with existing javascript web frameworks. it works the way i want it to work and it has the things i want it to have. if it doesn't have something you want it to have, and you're not my friend, i won't add it for you. the good news is that the framework is designed to be as extensible as possible, so you can probably add the thing yourself. if you run into a bug and it's not one that affects me or my friends, i won't fix it.

tl;dr this is something i made for myself, you are welcome to use it, just don't expect me to treat it like something i made for others.

## why not rust

sometimes it makes more sense to use typescript

## why not `x`.js

i don't really like `x`.js

## can you support commonjs

no.

## can you change the license

no.
